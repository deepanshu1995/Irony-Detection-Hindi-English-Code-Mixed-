# Irony-Detection-Hindi-English-Code-Mixed-

We have created a dataset of Hindi-English Code-Mixed Social Media Text, which consists of Tweets from Twitter. 
Tweets are annotated with the associated class label i.e, Ironic or Non-Ironic

Due to privacy policy of twitter we are releasing only tweet ids not the tweet text. Tweet text can be requested from us by
mailing at deepanshuvijay01995@gmail.com

This dataset in in development and in future we will extend this to more number of sentences.
